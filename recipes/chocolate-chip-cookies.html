        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>130 g (½ cups) Unsalted butter room temperature</li>
            <li>120 (½ cups) Brown sugar</li>
            <li>50 g (¼ cups) Granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>160 g (1⅓ cups) All purpose flour</li>
            <li>40 (⅓ cups) Walnut flour</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Baking soda</li>
            <li>150 g (⅘ cups) Chocolate chips semi-sweet high quality chocolate eg. Callebaut</li>
            <li>150 g (1⅕ cups) Walnuts chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>With an electric hand mixer whip room temperature butter with the two different kinds of sugar for a few minutes</li>
            <li>Mix in the egg, just until combined</li>
            <li>Mix flour, walnut flour, salt, and baking soda together then add this mixture to the wet ingredients and fold with the help of a Rubber spatula just until combined. Do not overmix</li>
            <li>Fold in chocolate chips and walnuts. Leave some for later so you can place more chocolate chips and nuts on top of the half baked cookies</li>
            <li>Prepare 2 baking pans with parchment papers</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 10 equal balls (using a Digital scale is handy) and place them onto the parchment papers leaving enough space between them to spread. I recommend baking 5 cookies at once</li>
            <li>Do not soften the surface of the balls, in fact, try to keep it as rough as possible for a nice, crackly surface. Press some more chocolate chips and walnuts on the surface of the cookies</li>
            <li>Let cookie dough rest in the fridge for an hour</li>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 175 C / 347°F (no fan)</li>
            <li>After 1h chilling time, bake the cookies for 15 minutes in the following way: Bake for 10 minutes then place more walnuts and chocolate chips on top, then bake them for further 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the cookies rest for a few minutes, then carefully remove them from the parchment and let them cool on a Cooling rack. Sprinkle with sea salt</li>
            <li>Serve them while they are slightly warm</li>
            <li>The cookies will further set as they cool. Store at room temp for a few days in air tight jar</li>
        </ol>
